# Forwarder 

This project is nothing but simple REST service built as a practice of core Spring Boot, Hibernate & SQL concepts. 

It provides, as far as we act like it's available on the web, very basic management over forwarders & drivers in assumed TSL company. My goal was to focus mostly at proper database structure & relationships, as well as include some more complex logic instead of just limit the code to basic CRUD actions.   

## Guide

There are few entities connected in one structure. At the top `Forwarder` take his place. Each one contains primitive data as well as connected object `Carriage`, which represents a vehicle in a fleet. One forwarder may have multiple carriages, each carriage should be linked with `Driver` as one to one relationships and contains list of `Freight`.


## Forwarder

Primary endpoint `/api/forwarders` returns following response:

Specific forwarder data returned by `/api/forwarders/{forwarderId}` with response:
```json
{
    "id": 3,
    "firstName": "Kamil",
    "lastName": "WÃ³jcik",
    "dob": "1976-11-09T23:00:00.000+00:00",
    "carriages": []
}
```
POST and PUT methods are managed by default by one endpoint `/api/forwarders`. In order to actually add new forwarder instead of update, it's necessary to set request body id as `0`.

Removing existing forwarder with `/api/forwarders/{forwarderId}`.

At the moment it's also possible to get information about total value of freights assigned to the specific forwarder `/api/forwarders/{forwarderId}/value`.
```json
{
    "value": 705,
    "freights": 2
}
```

# Carriage

First, general response `/api/carriages` with following response:
```json
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "plates": "ZS198GT",
        "pricePerKm": 0.55,
        "adr": true,
        "driver": {},
        "freights": []
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "plates": "ZST998Y",
        "pricePerKm": 0.53,
        "adr": false,
        "driver": {},
        "freights": []

}
```

POST / PUT same as before `/api/carriages` with request body id of "0" if evoke of save method expected or no id but with `foreign id` of linked forwarder.

Removing existing carriage with `/api/carriages/{carriageId}`

It's also possible to get just driver data `/api/carriages/{carriageId}/driver` based on given carriage id
```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "firstName": "Marcin",
    "lastName": "Nowak",
    "dob": "1976-11-09T23:00:00.000+00:00",
    "licenceNumber": "PDTY7823W/2016"
}
```
as well as requesting `/api/carriages/{carriageId}/freights` for list of freights done by given carriage
```json
[
    {
        "id": 6,
        "orderNumber": "FAV/556/2023",

        "value": 690.0,
        "adr": true
    }
]
```
and calculate total value of freights and distance driven by with `/api/carriages/{carriageId}/value`
```json

    "totalValue": 1075,
    "totalDistance": 1848,
    "freights": 3
}
```
